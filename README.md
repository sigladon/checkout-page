I completed the  challenge with HTML and CSS. This is the sixth challenge of DevChallenges I complete. This challenge helped me to know better the types of input, how to correctly make a form and stylize it. I tried to implement more javascript code to have a more interactive result, but it was not possible. Maybe in the future I will improve it. 
### Built With
